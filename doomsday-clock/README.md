# Doomsday Clock

The validity of [`async-local`](https://crates.io/crates/async-local) is predicated upon the guarantee that for a given runtime sequence to be supported, shutdowns sequencing ensures no tasks be dropped by thread local destructors. Leveraging this, [`async-local`](https://crates.io/crates/async-local) can synchronize runtime thread drops in a way that guarantees [`LocalRef`](https://docs.rs/async-local/latest/async_local/struct.LocalRef.html) and [`RefGuard`](https://docs.rs/async-local/latest/async_local/struct.RefGuard.html) never outlive the [`Context`](https://docs.rs/async-local/latest/async_local/struct.Context.html) for which they point to. Doomsday Clock is an async runtime shutdown test specifically designed to panic should shutdown not be sequenced in a way that will avoid potential dangling references using the techniques outlined within [`async-local`](https://crates.io/crates/async-local).
